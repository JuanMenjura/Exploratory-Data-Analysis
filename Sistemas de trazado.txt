  |===                                                                                                   |   3%
| In this lesson, we'll give you a brief overview of the three plotting systems in R, their differences,
| strengths, and weaknesses. We'll only cover the basics here to give you a general idea of the systems and in
| later lessons we'll cover each system in more depth.

...

  |======                                                                                                |   5%
| The first plotting system is the Base Plotting System which comes with R. It's the oldest system which uses a
| simple "Artist's palette" model. What this means is that you start with a blank canvas and build your plot up
| from there, step by step.

...

  |========                                                                                              |   8%
| Usually you start with a plot function (or something similar), then you use annotation functions to add to or
| modify your plot. R provides many annotating functions such as text, lines, points, and axis. R provides
| documentation for each of these. They all add to an already existing plot.

...

  |===========                                                                                           |  11%
| What do you think is a disadvantage of the Base Plotting System?

1: You can't go back once a plot has started
2: A complicated plot is a series of simple R commands
3: It mirrors how we think of building plots and analyzing data
4: It's intuitive and exploratory

Selection: 1

| That's a job well done!

  |==============                                                                                        |  14%
| Yes! The base system is very intuitive and easy to use when you're starting to do exploratory graphing and
| looking for a research direction. You can't go backwards, though, say, if you need to readjust margins or fix
| a misspelled a caption. A finished plot will be a series of R commands, so it's difficult to translate a
| finished plot into a different system.

...

  |=================                                                                                     |  16%
| We've loaded the dataset cars for you to demonstrate how easy it is to plot. First, use the R command head
| with cars as an argument to see what the data looks like.

> head(cars)
  speed dist
1     4    2
2     4   10
3     7    4
4     7   22
5     8   16
6     9   10

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |===================                                                                                   |  19%
| So the dataset collates the speeds and distances needed to stop for 50 cars. This data was recorded in the
| 1920's.

...

  |======================                                                                                |  22%
| We'll use the R command with which takes two arguments. The first specifies a dataset or environment in which
| to run the second argument, an R expression. This will save us a bit of typing. Try running the command with
| now using cars as the first argument and a call to plot as the second. The call to plot will take two
| arguments, speed and dist. Please specify them in that order.

> with(cars, plot(speed, dist))

| Keep up the great work!

  |=========================                                                                             |  24%
| Simple, right? You can see the relationship between the two variables, speed and distance. The first variable
| is plotted along the x-axis and the second along the y-axis.

...

  |============================                                                                          |  27%
| Now we'll show you what the function text does. Run the command text with three arguments. The first two, x
| and y coordinates, specify the placement of the third argument, the text to be added to the plot. Let the
| first argument be mean(cars$speed), the second max(cars$dist), and the third the string "SWIRL rules!". Try
| it now.

> text(mean(cars$speed), max(cars$dist), "SWIRL rules")

| Not quite, but you're learning! Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Type text(mean(cars$speed),max(cars$dist),"SWIRL rules!") at the command prompt.

> text(mean(cars$speed), max(cars$dist), "SWIRL rules!")

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |==============================                                                                        |  30%
| Ain't it the truth?

...

  |=================================                                                                     |  32%
| Now we'll move on to the second plotting system, the Lattice System which comes in the package of the same
| name. Unlike the Base System, lattice plots are created with a single function call such as xyplot or bwplot.
| Margins and spacing are set automatically because the entire plot is specified at once.

...

  |====================================                                                                  |  35%
| The lattice system is most useful for conditioning types of plots which display how y changes with x across
| levels of z. The variable z might be a categorical variable of your data. This system is also good for
| putting many plots on a screen at once.

...

  |=======================================                                                               |  38%
| The lattice system has several disadvantages. First, it is sometimes awkward to specify an entire plot in a
| single function call. Annotating a plot may not be especially intuitive. Second, using panel functions and
| subscripts is somewhat difficult and requires preparation. Finally, you cannot "add" to the plot once it is
| created as you can with the base system.

...

  |=========================================                                                             |  41%
| As before, we've loaded some data for you in the variable state. This data comes with the lattice package and
| it concerns various characteristics of the 50 states in the U.S. Use the R command head to see the first few
| entries of state now.

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |============================================                                                          |  43%
| As you can see state holds 9 pieces of information for each of the 50 states. The last variable, region,
| specifies a category for each state. Run the R command table with the argument state$region to see how
| many categories there are and how many states are in each.

> table(state$region)

| Nice work!

  |===============================================                                                       |  46%
| So there are 4 categories and the 50 states are sorted into them appropriately. Let's use the lattice
| command xyplot to see how life expectancy varies with income in each of the four regions.

...

  |==================================================                                                    |  49%
| To do this we'll give xyplot 3 arguments. The first is the most complicated. It is this R formula,
| Life.Exp ~ Income | region, which indicates we're plotting life expectancy as it depends on income for
| each region. The second argument, data, is set equal to state. This allows us to use "Life.Exp" and
| "Income" in the formula instead of specifying the dataset state for each term (as in state$Income). The
| third argument, layout, is set equal to the two-long vector c(4,1). Run xyplot now with these three
| arguments.

> xyplot(Life.Exp ~ Income | region, data = state, layout(c(4, 1)) )
Error in layout(c(4, 1)) : 
  layout matrix must contain at least one reference
to each of the values {1 ... 4}
> xyplot(Life.Exp ~ Income | region, data = state, layout = c(4, 1))

| Excellent job!

  |====================================================                                                  |  51%
| We see the data for each of the 4 regions plotted in one row. Based on this plot, which region of the U.S.
| seems to have the shortest life expectancy?

1: Northeast
2: West
3: South
4: North Central

Selection: 3

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |=======================================================                                               |  54%
| Just for fun rerun the xyplot and this time set layout to the vector c(2,2). To save typing use the up arrow
| to recover the previous xyplot command.

> xyplot(Life.Exp ~ Income | region, data = state, layout = c(2, 2))

| You are amazing!

  |==========================================================                                            |  57%
| See how the plot changed? No need for you to worry about margins or labels. The package took care of all that
| for you.

...

  |=============================================================                                         |  59%
| Now for the last plotting system, ggplot2, which is a hybrid of the base and lattice systems. It
| automatically deals with spacing, text, titles (as Lattice does) but also allows you to annotate by "adding"
| to a plot (as Base does), so it's the best of both worlds.

...

  |===============================================================                                       |  62%
| Although ggplot2 bears a superficial similarity to lattice, it's generally easier and more intuitive to use.
| Its default mode makes many choices for you but you can still customize a lot. The package is based on a
| "grammar of graphics" (hence the gg in the name), so you can control the aesthetics of your plots. For
| instance, you can plot conditioning graphs and panel plots as we did in the lattice example.

...

  |==================================================================                                    |  65%
| We'll see an example now of ggplot2 with a simple (single) command. As before, we've loaded a dataset for you
| from the ggplot2 package. This mpg data holds fuel economy data between 1999 and 2008 for 38 different models
| of cars. Run head with mpg as an argument so you get an idea of what the data looks like.

| Oh, there are 38 models. We're interested in the effect engine displacement (displ) has on highway gas
| mileage (hwy), so we'll use the ggplot2 command qplot to display this relationship. Run qplot now with three
| arguments. The first two are the variables displ and hwy we want to plot, and the third is the argument data
| set equal to mpg. As before, this allows us to avoid using the mpg$variable notation for the first two
| arguments.

> qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg)

| Nice work!

  |=============================================================================                         |  76%
| Not surprisingly we see that the bigger the engine displacement the lower the gas mileage.
