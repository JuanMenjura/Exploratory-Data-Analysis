| In this lesson, we'll discuss some basic principles of presenting data effectively. These will illustrate
| some fundamental concepts of displaying results in order to make them more meaningful and convincing. These
| principles are cribbed from Edward Tufte's great 2006 book, Beautiful Evidence. You can read more about
| them at the www.edwardtufte.com website.

| You're ready to start. Graphs give us a visual form of data, and the first principle of analytic graphs is
| to show some comparison. You'll hear more about this when you study statistical inference (another great
| course BTW), but evidence for a hypothesis is always relative to another competing or alternative
| hypothesis.

...

  |===========                                                                                         |  11%
| When presented with a claim that something is good, you should always ask "Compared to What?" This is why
| in commercials you often hear the phrase "other leading brands". An implicit comparison, right?

...

  |==============                                                                                      |  14%
| Consider this boxplot which shows the relationship between the use of an air cleaner and the number of
| symptom-free days of asthmatic children. (The top and bottom lines of the box indicate the 25% and 75%
| quartiles of the data, and the horizontal line in the box shows the 50%.) Since the box is above 0, the
| number of symptom-free days for children with asthma is bigger using the air cleaner. This is good, right?

...

  |=================                                                                                   |  17%
| How many days of improvement does the median correspond to?

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |===================                                                                                 |  19%
| While it's somewhat informative, it's also somewhat cryptic, since the y-axis is claiming to show a change
| in number of symptom-free days. Wouldn't it be better to show a comparison?

...

  |======================                                                                              |  22%
| Like this? Here's a graphic which shows two boxplots, the one on the left showing the results for a control
| group that doesn't use an air cleaner alongside the previously shown boxplot.

...

  |=========================                                                                           |  25%
| By showing the two boxplots side by side, you can clearly see that using the air cleaner increases the
| number of symptom-free days for most asthmatic children. The plot on the right (using the air cleaner) is
| generally higher than the one on the left (the control group).

...

  |============================                                                                        |  28%
| What does this graph NOT show you?

1: 75% of the children using the air cleaner had at most 3 symptom-free days
2: Children in the control group had at most 3 symptom-free days
3: Using the air cleaner makes asthmatic children sicker
4: Half the chidren in the control group had no improvement

| So the first principle was to show a comparison. The second principle is to show causality or a mechanism
| of how your theory of the data works. This explanation or systematic structure shows your causal framework
| for thinking about the question you're trying to answer.

  |=================================                                                                   |  33%
| Consider this plot which shows the dual boxplot we just showed, but next to it we have a corresponding plot
| of changes in measures of particulate matter.

| This picture tries to explain how the air cleaner increases the number of symptom-free days for asthmatic
| children. What mechanism does the graph imply?

1: That the children in the control group are healthier
2: That the air cleaner reduces pollution
3: That the air cleaner increases pollution
4: That the air in the control group is cleaner than the air in the other group

| By showing the two sets of boxplots side by side you're explaining your theory of why the air cleaner

| What is multivariate data you might ask? In technical (scientific) literature this term means more than 2
| variables. Two-variable plots are what you saw in high school algebra.  Remember those x,y plots when you
| were learning about slopes and intercepts and equations of lines? They're valuable, but usually questions
| are more complicated and require more variables.

| What does the blue regression line indicate?

1: As pollution increases more people die
2: Pollution doesn't really increase, it just gets reported more
3: As pollution increases the number of deaths doesn't change
4: As pollution increases fewer people die

| Fewer deaths with more pollution? That's a surprise! Something's gotta be wrong, right? In fact, this is an example
| of Simpson's paradox, or the Yule-Simpson effect. Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox) tells
| us that this "is a paradox in probability and statistics, in which a trend that appears in different groups of data
| disappears when these groups are combined."

| The fourth principle of analytic graphing involves integrating evidence. This means not limiting yourself to one
| form of expression. You can use words, numbers, images as well as diagrams. Graphics should make use of many modes
| of data presentation. Remember, "Don't let the tool drive the analysis!"

...

  |========================================================================                            |  72%
| To show you what we mean, here's an example of a figure taken from a paper published in the Journal of the AMA. It
| shows the relationship between pollution and hospitalization of people with heart disease. As you can see, it's a
| lot different from our previous plots. The solid circles in the center portion indicate point estimates of
| percentage changes in hospitalization rates for different levels of pollution. The lines through the circles
| indicate confidence intervals associated with these estimates. (You'll learn more about confidence intervals in
| another great course, the one on statistical inference.)

...

  |===========================================================================                         |  75%
| Note that on the right side of the figure is another column of numbers, one for each of the point estimates given.
| This column shows posterior probabilities that relative risk is greater than 0. This, in effect, is a measure of the
| strength of the evidence showing the correlation between pollution and hospitalization.  The point here is that all
| of this information is located in one picture so that the reader can see the strength of not only the correlations
| but the evidence as well.

  |==============================================================================                      |  78%
| The fifth principle of graphing involves describing and documenting the evidence with sources and appropriate labels
| and scales. Credibility is important so the data graphics should tell a complete story. Also, using R, you want to
| preserve any code you use to generate your data and graphics so that the research can be replicated if necessary.
| This allows for easy verification or finding bugs in your analysis.

| The sixth and final principle of analytic graphing is maybe the most important. Content is king! If you don't have
| something interesting to report, your graphs won't save you. Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall
| depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity of their content.
